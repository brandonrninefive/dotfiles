# My Dotfiles

The Linux dotfiles for my i3-gaps desktop environment and the applications I use on top of it. I'm fairly new to the Linux ricing scene, so this repo is an active WIP.

## Neat programs that I use
I found most of these by browsing [r/UnixPorn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) on Reddit, you should check it out!
- [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) (tiling window manager - everything else I use is based on this)
- [feh](https://github.com/derf/feh) (simple image viewer, good for displaying a desktop in i3)
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) (application menu and dmenu alternative)
- [cava](https://github.com/karlstav/cava) (in-terminal audio visualizer)
- [scrot](https://github.com/dreamer/scrot) (screenshots from terminal)
- [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) (in-terminal file manager) 
- [urxvt](https://github.com/exg/rxvt-unicode) (highly customizable terminal emulator)
- [polybar](https://polybar.github.io/) (highly customizable task bar(s))
- [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) (display system overview in terminal)
- [lolcat](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat) (display text in rainbow colors)
- [cowsay](https://github.com/schacon/cowsay) (make an ascii cow say things)
